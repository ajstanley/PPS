      <h1>Adaptive Kayaking</h1>
      <p>The Adaptive Kayaking Session will focus on how accessible kayaking is as a form of recreation to people
        living with barriers. Duncan Mack and Megan Millar will present some of the techniques and tools they use at
        work with Power To Be Adventure Therapy Society’s Adaptive Kayaking Programs, a Victoria based non-profit that
        strives to inspire youth and families in need of support to discover their limitless abilities through
        nature-based programs. With a strong background in providing therapeutic outdoor adventures for people living
        with cognitive or physical limitations, Megan and Duncan will share their experience and stories about how
        kayaking is truly a sport for everyone - providing access to a world that often is viewed as exclusive,
        through focusing on abilities and tapping into ones’ ingenuity and tenacious spirit.

      <p>Techniques for making kayaking accessible will be discussed and adaptive equipment will be demonstrated,
        along with a Power Point presentation and opportunities for group interaction.  This workshop will simulate
        a sense of what our clients live with everyday, while creating an opportunity for those in the kayak community
        to expand their vision of accessibility and adventure. The Adaptive Kayaking Workshop offers examples, tools,
        perspectives and solutions in the hopes that workshop participants could leave inspired to bridge the gaps
        back in their own community by increasing access to kayaking opportunities for all.
