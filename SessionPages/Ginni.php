      <h1>South Seas Voyage: Mexico to New Zealand by Sailboat & Kayak</h1>

      <img src="GinniPics/Ginni1.jpg" class="floatRight">

      <p>Miraculous it was that two sea kayaks fit on deck, bracketing a hard-shelled rowing dinghy, with an inch on
        either side. But they did, and that’s how we set out to cross the world’s biggest ocean: two Romanys,
        “Mutiny” the dinghy, the Good Captain Henrick Lindström, a stuffed moose, a drunk koala, and me, all
        on the 36’ steel-hulled sailboat “Misty”.
      </p>
      <p>She was double-ended, like a canoe, cutter-rigged with one mast, narrow in the beam, 45  years old, and seaworthy.
        We hoped. Sailing across an ocean is an act of faith.
      </p>
      <img src="GinniPics/Ginni2.jpg" width="55%" class="floatLeft">
      <p>There were seabirds and sunsets, atolls and outriggers. There was me trying to tow 10 tons of steel through the
        doldrums by kayak. There was Henrick dangling off the stern at night in 30kts of wind to fix the wind-steering
        arm for the 4th time. There were three sharks bumping the kayak in Fakarava Pass. There were the reef lobsters
        we never found, and the coconut crab we did.
      </p>
      <p>There were single-handed crossings in Tahiti and Tonga, Henrick on “Misty” and me in “Green Flash”. There were
        ancient non-instrument navigation methods to study. And stars!
      </p>
      <p>And through it all, supporting it all, was the unbelievable electric cobalt of the open sea.</p>
