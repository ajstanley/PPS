      <p style="font-weight:bold">In the fall of 2010, three kayakers paddled the length of B.C.'s pristine coast to connect and engage citizens
        about the risks posed by the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May of 2010, Enbridge Inc. made an official application to build twined crude oil and condensate pipelines that
        would connect Alberta's Tar Sands to Kitimat, BC, and for the first time bring crude oil super tankers to BC's North Coast.
        In the fall of 2010, Curtis, Ryan and Faroe kayaked 900 km in opposition to this controversial pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their journey leads them face to face with the complexity of the environmental assessment process, the difficulties
        local communities face in having their voices heard, and the growing resistance against the pipeline. Leaving the city
        behind for adventure and the exploration of the isolated and dangerous coast of British Columbia, they immerse
        themselves completely in one of the last truly wild places on Earth. The trio becomes deeply impacted by their
        experience, irreversibly entangled in the Pacific Northwest, and awakened to a world of power, politics and the
        question of democracy.
