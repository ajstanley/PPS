  <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Payment in full is due at the time of registration.</strong></p>
  <p>Should you need to cancel your reservation prior to 01 May 2013 a refund
    will be issued, minus a $75 processing fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No refunds will be issued for cancellation after May 1.</strong>

  <p>
    If the Pacific Paddling Symposium is cancelled, a full refund will be issued. 
    Because ocean conditions and winds can change quickly, we reserve the right to adjust sessions accordingly
    to best suit the environmental conditions.
    These changes will be necessary to keep everyone safe.
