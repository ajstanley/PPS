      on sea kayaking for over 15. She is certified BCU 5-star Sea Leader and Level 4 coach, and 
      ACA Level 5 Instructor. She co-owns Columbia River Kayaking, and Sea Kayak Baja Mexico.
    </p>

      She organized on-water instruction at the West Coast Sea Kayak Symposium for several years and
      ran the Lower Columbia Kayak Roundup. She travels to coaching events in such exotic places 
      as Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Chicago, and Vancouver Island.

      Ginni is also the North American importer of Flat Earth Kayak Sails. This past year, 
      she played hooky from it all and sailed across the Pacific Ocean with boyfriend and kayak.
