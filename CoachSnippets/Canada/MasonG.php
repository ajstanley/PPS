    <p>Greg has been part of the White Squall team out in Georgian Bay since 1992. While he really likes guiding, he has become really interested in the teaching/coaching aspect
      of sea kayaking. He is certified by Paddle Canada as a Level 2 Instructor Trainer, Level 3 Instructor and has Level 4 skills. He also really enjoys getting out in big winds
      and waves and out on the rivers in his whitewater kayak.

    <p>Greg also works with the UNESCO designated Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve an organization that helps to conserve the environment of Georgian Bay and help
      promote sustainable communities and economies for the eastern Georgian Bay region.
