    <p>Mike has been paddling in the Victoria area for over 25 years and thinks that it is one of the best places in
      the world to paddle! Mike is a PC level 4 paddler and PC level 1 instructor as well as a SKGABC level 2 guide.
    </p>
    <p>Fifteen years ago, he discovered the Greenland paddle and was an instant convert. Since then he has learned to
      use the GP for almost all of his paddling (including touring most of Vancouver Island). In addition he found the
      GP a big asset for rolling and has managed to master a good selection of Greenland rolls. He competed in the
      2010 and 2011 Kayak Academy Greenland competition, placing third in the rolling competition each time.

      Mike is also a founding member of Victoriaâ€™s sea kayaking club, SISKA. </p>
