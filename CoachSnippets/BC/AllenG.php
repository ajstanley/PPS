      Prior to 1998 Gary was active in many sports, including climbing, mountaineering, back country skiing, bicycle
      racing (both road and track) and mountain biking. In 1998 he broke his leg in a mountain biking accident,
      which led him to try sea kayaking. Needless to say, kayaking took over his sporting life.Â

      Gary has since attained his Paddle Canada LV 4 skills certification and is a PC LV 3 sea kayak instructor as
      well as a certified kayak guide. He has been teaching sea kayaking at Ocean River Sports in Victoria BC for the
      past 11 years. 5 years ago he tried SUP in Kauai and now he teaches SUP here also. Gary is now looking forward
      to his annual April trip to Kauai to enjoy SUP in warm water!
